# Better Typing Game
This game is made to encourage/reward the user to look up at the screen instead of looking down at the keyboard.
Words on the screen that are constantly changing would require the user to look at the screen and pay attention to what is happening.
The game should not be able to be easily beaten by looking at your keyboard.
Looking down at the keyboard should hinder the player from rewards and actively work against the player.

### Game Idea
In our idea, the player has to fight a monster that has attacks the player has to block in order to stay alive long enough to defeat the monster.
To do so, words will appear on the screen when the monster is going to attack and the player will have to type the word in time before they get hit.
To defeat the monster, the player will have to react to words that appear on the screen and type the words to damage the monster.
This will continue until the monster is defeated or the player loses.

- Most importantly, encouraging the player to look at the screen
